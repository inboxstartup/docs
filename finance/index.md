# Finance

Startups that are looking to be venture-funded are usually not advised to Crowdfund, and if possible avoid `Startup Studios` which are asking for outsized equity for their services. The idea is to conserve your equity and avoid liquidation, especially at early stage.

## Tools

- [Pilot](https://pilot.com) - Bookkeeping, CFO, and tax services for startups and growing businesses.
